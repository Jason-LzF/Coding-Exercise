Instruction on how to use filter_test.go:
1. Download all the files(filter.go, filter_test.go and vulns.json) and put them into the same workspace
2. Use go test command
3. Inside the filter_test.go, there are comments which explain how to test different erroneous/strange input. Make sure each time only one test function is used.

Note: please use the vulns.json file uploaded since there is very little modification on the data file in
order to make it be successfully decoded into Go values.
