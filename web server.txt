Instruction on how to use the web server(the main program):
1. Download all the files(filter.go, filter_test.go and vulns.json) and put them into the same workspace
2. Use go build filter.go command
3. Type in filter and then press enter
4. At this point, it is listening on the given address:port(":9999", in filter.go). Then open the web browser and type in the http request: http://localhost:9999/?...... where "......" is the query parameters. For instance, if severity_at_least=8, since=2016-01-03, limit=21 then the http request will
be http://localhost:9999/?severity_at_least=8&since=2016-01-03&limit=21(the order of parameters can be 
different).
5. After the web server handles a http request, stop the running of filter.go(e.g., use control+C) and then run the program
again. At this point, another http request can be handled and the response can be seen on the screen.
6. Every time before sending a new http request, do step 5.

Note: please use the vulns.json file uploaded since there is very little modification on the data file in
order to make it be successfully decoded into Go values.
