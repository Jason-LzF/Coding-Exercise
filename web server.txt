Instruction on how to use the web server(filter.go):
1. Download all the files and put them into the same workspace
2. Use go build filter.go command
3. Type in filter and then press enter
4. At this point, it is listening on the given address:port(":9999", in filter.go). Then open the web browser and type in the http request: http://localhost:9999/?...... where "......" is the query parameters. For instance, if severity_at_least=8, since=2016-01-03, limit=21 then the http request will
be http://localhost:9999/?severity_at_least=8&since=2016-01-03&limit=21(the order of parameters can be 
different).
5. At this point, a response can be seen on the screen.
6. A http request with different parameters may be typed in the web browser to generate a different list of vulnerabilities when filter.go is running.
7. "control+C" can be used to terminate the program.

Note: please use the vulns.json file uploaded since there is very little modification on the data file in
order to make it be successfully decoded into Go values.
